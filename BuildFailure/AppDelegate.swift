#if DEBUG && canImport(SwiftUI)

/// When building in Version 11.4 (11E146) on Catalina (10.15.4),
/// I hit an issue where the above `canImport(SwiftUI)` check passes, but the below
/// fails to compile with
///
/// ```
/// Use of undeclared type 'View'
/// ```
/// (etc)
///
/// So far I've only been able to reproduce this with an iPhone 5 simulator selected:
/// iPhone 5 OS 10.3.1 (14E8301)
///
/// When an iPad Pro (11-inch) (1st generation) is selected, it builds fine
/// > iPad Pro (11-inch) (1st generation) iOS 12.1 (16B91)
///
/// /// When an iPhone 6s is selected, it also builds fine
/// > iPhone 6s iOS 11.1 (15B87)
///
/// Which is weird, because SwiftUI is also not available on iOS 12 or iOS 11.
///
/// I'm guessing this means there's some weirdness in Xcode around iOS 10 and the canImport check? Or something?
///
/// Anyways...
